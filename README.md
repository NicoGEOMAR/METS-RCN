# METS-RCN
Metadata of time series stations (BGC pilot product)

Each eventfile provides the general metadata of the site. It further lists related datasets and includes subevents which give more detailed information about individual station visits that included biogeochemical measurements.
These subevents are categorized accoring to similar methods applied for collecting and analyzing the samples. 


Each dataset file provides information about related datasets of the time series stations. The metadata of the overarching data product pilot is also given here.

The raw github sitemap has a flawed XML prolog, so we deploy it via [github pages](https://earthcube.github.io/METS-RCN/Examples/)
